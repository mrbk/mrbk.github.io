     Hyunsu Kong successfully defended his PhD thesis on Tuesday, July 15 in
     front of a packed classroom. His research focuses on a novel code for
     tracking dark matter structures deep within the gravitational potentials of
     more massive dark matter halos. He will be moving to a postdoc position at
     RPI in New York in mid-August. <i>Congratulations, Dr. Kong!</i> <br /><br />

  style="font-weight:bold;" target="_blank" >The Absolute Age of Milky Way
  Globular Clusters</a><br /> <i>Ying, Chaboyer, Boylan-Kolchin, Weisz, and
  Goebel-Bain (2025), ApJ, <b>987</b>, 52</i> <br />
    
    An ironclad property of the Universe is that it should not be younger than
    the oldest objects inside it. Globular clusters (GCs) are coeval collections
    of ancient stars and therefore are excellent candidates for measuring lower
    limits to the age of the Universe. In the 1980s and 1990s, in fact, the ages
    of GCs provided early evidence that the then-standard cosmological model was
    incorrect, presaging the discovery of dark energy in 1998.<br /><br />
    
    The rise of the cosmic microwave background as a precision cosmological
    probe in the early 2000s led astronomers to abandon GC ages for
    cosmology. However, there are good reasons for revisiting them now: (1) the
    dramatic increase in computational power since the 1990s allows for much
    more complete and efficient exploration of the large parameter space of
    models of stars, and (2) the existence of the "Hubble tension", a mismatch
    in the measured expansion rate of the Universe, might point to a systematic
    error in interpretation of cosmic microwave background data. Crucially,
    ages measured from stars are <i>completely independent</i> of those measured
    cosmologically, making them excellent cross-checks of our cosmological
    model.<br /><br />

    In this paper, I teamed up with experts on the properties of stars to
    revisit the question of the ages of the oldest GCs. We found that they are
    consistently very old, but not older than the age of the Universe inferred
    from cosmological probes within our current cosmological paradigm (13.8
    billion years). However, the ages are old enough that solutions to the
    Hubble tension that require modifying the physics of the early Universe are
    mildly in tension with the data (because those models predict the Universe
    is about 1 billion years younger than is currently thought). This is the
    second paper we've written on this topic, and I hope to follow up with a
    paper on the cosmological interpretation of these data. It's a very exciting
    time for studying the Universe using its oldest stars! <br /><br />

    Holes Impact the Formation of the First Stars and Galaxies?</a> <br />
    <i>Zhang, Liu, Bromm, Jeon, Boylan-Kolchin, and K&#252;hnel (2025), ApJ,
    <b>987</b>, 185</i>

<br /> Data from JWST have revealed a stunningly high level of star formation
and black hole growth in the early Universe, so much so that we are beginning to
consider whether we must appeal to non-standard mechanisms to explain the
data. One possibility is the existence of black holes that formed shortly after
the big bang from the collapse of larger-than-expected inhomogeneities, so
called "primordial black holes". This
contrasts with the typical picture, where the biggest black holes we see formed
through either the deaths of stars and subsequent growth or else through the
direct collapse of gas clouds. In both of these (standard) scenarios, it is
very difficult to get black holes massive enough to explain observations. In the
primordial black hole scenario, it is much easier to understand how massive
black holes could have emerged so early in the evolution of the cosmos.<br />
<br />

In this paper, we (S. Zhang, a graduate student working with Volker Bromm, and a
handful of collaborators) investigated how massive primordial black holes affect
early star and galaxy formation. We showed that they accelerate early structure
formation, but somewhat surprisingly, they can then cause a period of delay
because energy released by matter falling onto these primordial black holes
inhibits subsequent star formation. Overall, the picture of primordial black
holes compares favorably to observations, but we cannot rule out standard models
at this point. We discuss the potential future observations that would
definitively identify which scenario is correct.

    style="font-weight:bold;" target="_blank" >Bloodhound Unleashed:
    Particle-based Substructure Tracking for Cosmological Simulations</a> <br />
    <i>Kong, Boylan-Kolchin, and Bullock, submitted to MNRAS (2025);
    arXiv:2503.10766</i> <br />

Modern cosmology and galaxy formation studies rely on simulations to make
theoretical predictions and to compare to observations. These simulations have
become increasingly sophisticated and complex, as have comparisons with real
data. A key component of these comparisons is identifying either halos of dark
matter or the galaxies they host and tracking these objects across cosmic
time. This is fairly straightforward for objects that are isolated, but galaxies
and halos can orbit one another and even merge, which leads to many
complications. Since a minority of galaxies are satellites of larger systems,
many of the tools theorists have built are not optimized to find and track these
smaller units, which leads to numerical artifacts that can significantly affect
conclusions about these satellite galaxies. Crucially, this is precisely the
regime where we hope to obtain the best constraints on the nature of dark
matter, so our theoretical tools may actually be limiting factors in our
understanding of some of the deepest cosmological mysteries.<br /><br />

I tasked my graduate student Hyunsu Kong to come up with an alternate method for
tracking these thorny satellite systems based on their particles identified at
earlier times. Working also with my long-time collaborator James Bullock
(currently dean of the School of Physical Sciences at UC Irvine and soon to be
the dean of USC's Dornsife College of Letters, Arts, and Sciences), Hyunsu came
up with an array of improvements and advances that culminated in
<b>Bloodhound</b>, a new tracking tool. In this first paper about it, we discuss
the methods used and demonstrate the dramatic improvement in tracking it
provides relative to standard tools. Hyunsu continues to develop
<b>Bloodhound</b>, and I expect it will become an important component of future
analyses of cosmological simulations.

    style="font-weight:bold;" target="_blank" >The Hubble Space Telescope Survey
    of M31 Satellite Galaxies. IV. Survey Overview and Lifetime Star Formation
    Histories </a> <br /> <i>Savino et al., including Boylan-Kolchin (2025),
ApJ, <b>979</b>, 205</i> <br />

Virtually all of what we know about low-mass galaxies, which serve as crucibles
for our models of feedback from star formation and dark matter dynamics, comes
from studies of a handful of satellite galaxies that orbit the Milky Way. Data
on these
objects paint a compelling picture of how they formed, but a nagging concern is
that this picture is fundamentally determined by their very local
environment. Fortunately, we have another nearby massive galaxy with its own
coterie of low-mass galaxies: at 2.5 million light-years away, the Andromeda
galaxy is a natural complement to studies of the Milky Way. However, even at
this paltry (!!) distance, observations are extremely challenging.<br /><br />

As part of a large team, I worked to obtain and interpret deep Hubble Space
Telescope data on satellites of the Andromeda galaxy. We found many similarities
with the Milky Way system but some notable differences, including a
characteristic pause in star formation at intermediate cosmic times, which is
not observed in Milky Way satellites. Understanding these differences will help
us understand both the formation history of our own galaxy and how well we can
use these satellite galaxies to understand star formation conditions in the
early Universe and the nature of dark matter.

    style="font-weight:bold;" target="_blank" >Central Densities of Dark Matter
    Halos in FIRE-2 Simulations of Low-mass Galaxies with Cold Dark Matter and
Self-Interacting Dark Matter</a> <br />
<i>Straight, Boylan-Kolchin,
    Bullock, Hopkins, Shen, Necib, Lazar, Graus, and Samuel (2025), submitted to
MNRAS; arXiv:2501.16602 </i> <br />

The Milky Way hosts at
least 50 low-mass ("dwarf") satellite galaxies, and likely an order of magnitude more
await discovery. They are the subject of intense interest because they are
the most dark-matter-dominated systems in the Universe and therefore may be the
best places to learn about this enigmatic substance. The basic idea is that they
are so dark-matter-dominated that they may essentially reflect the formation of
galaxies under only the influence of gravity, as opposed to more massive
systems, where gas dynamics can be very important. If true, this would allow us
to directly compare the structure of these galaxies to sophisticated predictions
from numerical simulations and determine whether dark matter is "cold" and
"collisionless", as is assumed by our current cosmological model.<br /><br />

A potential confounding factor, however, is that the smattering of atomic matter
in these galaxies can pack enough of a punch to alter the structure of the
dominant dark matter component. My graduate student Maria Straight led analysis
of series of simulations of the evolution of the dark matter surrounding dwarf
galaxies, both with and without sophisticated models of galaxy formation and
with two different assumptions about the nature of dark matter. Her analysis
points to a key feature that can discriminate between features in the density
structure of dwarf galaxies caused by galaxy formation physics compared to those
caused by non-standard dark matter physics. Although very difficult to detect
observationally, this feature opens a new potential window for understanding
dark matter.
